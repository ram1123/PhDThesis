\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Difference between VBF and VBS:} From experimental point of view the difference between the two comes wheter a single boson is produced from two ($VV\rightarrow V$) or two boson is produced ($VV \rightarrow VV$). However, in principle the VBF process also alows us to seperatly study the aTGC and aQGC~\cite{Green2017}.
	\item If the broken direction in symmetry space also corresponds to a gauge symmetry (i.e. a space-time dependent symmetry) then the associated Goldstone boson and the massless gauge boson combine to form a massive gauge boson -- the Higgs mechanism~\cite{Chanowitz1988}.
