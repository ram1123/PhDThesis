\label{cha:ge1_1_measured_parameters}
In lab at CERN several parameters of the tested GE1/1 detectors are measured.
They are - electric field, voltage across each GEM foil, gain and rate for both GE1/1, i.e., GE11\_IV and GE11\_IV\_GIF.
% They are electric field, voltage across each GEM foil. Also, the gain and rate for both GE1/1, i.e., GE11\_IV and GE11\_IV\_GIF, are measured.

The high voltage configuration used during the beam test is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HV_configuration}.

Also, the voltage across the GEM foils and  the electric field  with respect to the current in the voltage divider is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GEM_voltage_electricfield}.

The gain of the detector was measured in the lab using an X-ray source for both $Ar:CO_2$ and $Ar:CO_2:CF_4$ gas mixture and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gain_GE1/1_IV_GIF} and ~\ref{fig:gain_GE1/1_IV}.
