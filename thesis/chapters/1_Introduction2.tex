\chapter{Introduction}
An understanding of how the world is put together requires a theory of how the elementary particles of matter interact with one another~\cite{Hooft1980}. There are many theories to explain this interaction but the theory that explains best is the SM. This is called as Model because it is based on some of experimental inputs. An important problem in physics is to understand the ultimate constituents of matter and the fundamental interactions that occur amongst them; it is of equal importance to establish whether these interactions are, in reality, different manifestations of a single underlying (or unified) interaction which is yet to be discovered. The weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in the electroweak theory of the SM at an energy scale already attained at particle accelerators around the world. The electroweak SM and the QCD, describing the strong interaction together forms the complete SM of the electroweak and strong interactions. However, there are strong reasons which suggest that the SM is not the ultimate theory and there must exist some phenomena beyond SM \cite{Quigg1985,article:PAdventure}


Presently, the most profound problem of the standard model is to find out the reason behind the spontaneous symmetry breaking\footnote{The spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place when a system, that is symmetric with respect to some symmetry group, goes into a vacuum state that is not symmetric. At this point the system no longer appears to behave in a symmetric manner}. This leads to solution of many problem that we are facing like the it gives the ideas about the mass generation, it solves the problem of unitarity in vector-boson scattering, etc. If we do not break the symmetry of system then all the force carrieres for all interaction should be massless but it is not observed in the nature. Thus, nature suggest that symmetry should be broken spontaneously. So, In next section I am going to describe brefily that how the spontaneous symmetry breaking solves the problem of mass generation. This is known as the Higgs mechanism [@article:higgs] [@article:Englert] [@article:kibble].






% However, the question is that how these fundamental particles will give insight into our universe?
% The answer is that in early universe there are only particles and if we go near the event horizon, then there was only quark gluons plasma.
% To verify these things, we cannot go back to the early universe, but we can probe them using the high energy colliders to know their behaviour.

% One of best model that explains the world around us at very fundamental level is the Standard Model (SM). With the discovery of the Higgs boson \cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} in 2012 it was complete. However, even now many questions remain unanswered by the SM. List of few questions are:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item How neutrino get its mass and what is its mass hierarchy? 
% \item Why there are only three generations of leptons and quarks? 
% \item Why the third generation is too much heavy as compared to other two generations?
% \end{itemize}

% And, a lot more questions whose answers we are trying to find out. There are two ways to answer these questions. First is to go for another new theory or a model like SUSY, string theory, and start to see if they explains the experimental data/information or not. Another way is to understand the SM profoundly and look for the possible extensions of SM. One of the possible ways is to look for WW scattering. As the Higgs boson unitrize the WW scattering amplitude, so its one of the best path to look for SM deviation.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Non-abelian nature $\rightarrow$ QGC in addition of trilinear gauge coupling.
% \item SM includes three types of GGC.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item $W^+W^-W^+W^-$
%     \item $W^+W^-ZZ$
%     \item $W^+W^-\gamma \gamma$
%     \end{itemize}
% \item ZZZZ vertex is not persent in SM but it is present at tree level via exchange of Higgs boson.
% \item $\gamma \gamma ZZ$ vertex is only produced at loop level in SM.
% \item Trilinear and quartic couplings probe different aspect of the weak interactions.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Trilinear coupling test the non-abelian nature of SM
%     \item Quartic coupling probe the EWSB.
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Heavy vector boson $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ acquire there mass and longitudinal polarization state through spontaneous EWSB.
% \item The mechanism for EWSB must regulate $\sigma(V_LV_L \rightarrow V_LV_L )$ to restore unitarity above $\approx$ 1-2 TeV.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item cross-section attenuated to a linear growth by the quartic gauge by the quartic gauge self coupling.
%     \item a light SM higgs boson exactly cancels increase for large s (for HWW coupling).
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
