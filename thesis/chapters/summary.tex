A search for anomalous electroweak production of $WW$, $WZ$, and $ZZ$ boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at $13$ TeV is reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $35.9$ fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$. The hadronically decaying $W/Z$ boson is reconstructed as one large-radius jet. Constraints on the quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of dimension-eight effective field theory operators are reported. The reported values are the most stringent limmits reported by the CMS Collaboration.
