Ever since the existence, mankind is striving to unravel mysteries of nature around us. Several theoretical frameworks have been developed to answer key questions regarding our existence in this Universe. Continuous endeavours of the thinkers and scientists in this regard lead to the evolution of a branch of physics, namely ``\textit{particle physics}'', dealing with the study of fundamental particles and the interactions amongst them. 

Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a theoretical framework, developed in the 1960s and 70s, which encapsulates nearly all that is known about the elementary particles and forces in a concise set of principles and equations. SM has been very successful in predicting the behaviour and certain characteristics of the elementary particles. It gives a compelling explanation of the existing experimental data. During 1960â€™s, while trying to unify the theories of electromagnetic and weak interactions it was realized that gauge bosons mediating these interactions should be massless which was in contradiction with the  experimental evidences~\cite{StandardModel67_1,StandardModel67_2,StandardModel67_3,}. This dilemma was resolved by P.W. Higgs, F. Englert, R. Brout  and others, by postulating that  the electroweak gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken~\cite{Englert1964,Higgs1964,Higgs1964a,Guralnik1964,Higgs1966,Kibble1967}, which gives mass to the elementary particles and the force carriers but it requires  a new scalar (spin-zero) particle, namely the Higgs boson. This new scalar boson not only provides mass to the elementary particles but it solves other problems such as: it preserves the unitarity of the Vector-Boson Scattering (VBS). It was the only missing link from SM till 2012. In 2012, it was observed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj,Aad:2012tfa}, and its properties were measured in the following years. This completes the picture of the elementary particles predicted by the SM. However, the SM still leaves some unexplained phenomena, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item reason behind spontaneous symmetry breaking?
    \item Is the Higgs boson only source for preserving the unitrization in vector-boson scattering? 
    \item reason behind the baryon asymmetry in universe? and many more.
\end{itemize}
After the discovery of Higgs Boson, the major goal of the physics programme at the LHC is to provide a definitive answer to these open questions by significantly expanding both the energy reach and the collision rate with respect to the previous experiments and its own Run periods.
Ongoing measurements at the LHC also include the precision measurements in the electroweak sectors and to look for VBS which could also hint towards the existence of new physics phenomenon, indirectly~\cite{Baak2013}. These measurements could provide information on the structure of $SU(2) \times U(1)$-breaking physics and its experimental signatures. 
The scattering of the vector bosons is strongly connected to the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in the SM, regulated by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. This study will help one to clearly understand the role of the observed Higgs boson in the EWSB. Because Recent discovery of the Higgs boson indicates that the ultimate EWSB should be similar to the existing Higgs mechanism which needs to be scrutinized.

VBS processes can also provides information on the quartic vector boson interactions, a part of the SM which has not been tested yet and could be modified by the existence of new physics. Given the large amount of  high-luminosity data available at the LHC, it is possible to probe this rare physics process using different final states. Thus, the VBS  emerges as a strong candidate process to serve the two-fold purpose to perform the precision measurements and side-by-side look for the new physics phenomenon.  
In this chapter, a brief introduction of the SM along with the EWSB is given. Also, the anomalous quartic gauge coupling and VBS are discussed briefly along with the doubly charged Higgs model in the framework of model created by the Georgi and Machacek.

\section{Brief Introduction of SM} % (fold)
\label{sec:brief_introduction_of_sm}
SM is the theory of elementary particles and their interactions. It is well tested and in good agreement with experimental results, obtained so far.

Till now we know of four fundamental interactions.
Out of the four, the gravitational interaction is not included in SM.
The other three forces - the strong force interaction as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the electromagnetic interaction as described by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the weak interaction - are included in the SM.
In 1979, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg were awarded Nobel prize for their effort to unify the theory of weak interaction and the quantum electrodynamics~\cite{StandardModel67_1,StandardModel67_2}.
This unified theory of weak interaction and quantum electrodynamics is known as the electroweak theory.

According to SM all the fundamental particles can be classified into two categories. They are fermions and bosons.

Fermions are the particles that obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics with half-integer spin.
In SM, fermions are further classified into leptons and quarks, which are listed in Table~\ref{table:smfermions}.
The quarks and leptons create the subatomic scaffolding for solid matter.
Quarks bind together to form protons and neutrons and the electrons orbit these cluster of quarks to form atoms and the atoms combine into all the known stable matter of universe~\cite{SM-buildingblock_uslhc}.
Till now we know the three generations of leptons as well as quarks. The different generations are differing only in the particle mass.

Bosons are the particles that obey the Bose-Einstein statistics with integer spin. In SM the bosons are the mediator of interactions between the particles, described by a local gauge theory. Thus, these bosons are called gauge bosons. All the bosons in SM are listed in Table~\ref{table:smbosons}.
The photon and gluons are massless carrying electromagnetic and strong force respectively. The $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons carry the weak force. These bosons are the spin 1 bosons and known as the vector-bosons. Whereas, the Higgs boson, H, is a scalar boson with spin 0. This is responsible for the mass generation (by giving longitudinal polarization) to the fundamental particles through EWSB, which is explained in section~\ref{sub:brief_introduction_to_higgs_mechanism}.

\subsection{Standard Model as Gauge theory}
Gauge invariance is the key ingredient in the construction of the SM of electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions of elementary particles. In general gauge principle specifies that for a given gauge symmetry group and the transformation of the fields, the quantum field theory can be uniquely defined~\cite{Coughlan2006}.
% Below the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is briefly discussed.

% \subsubsection{Example: Quantum Electrodynamics} % (fold)
% \label{ssub:example_quantum_electrodynamics}
The construction of QED is an example of local gauge theory as the Lagrangian function (Eq.~\ref{eq:qed_lagrangian}) that describes the QED of the spin-half particle remains invariant by the local gauge transformation of the electron field $\psi(x)$ and the photon field $A_{\mu(x)}$ at all space-time point x,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qed_lagrangian}
    \Lagr = i \bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu}\psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi,
    % \Lagr = i \bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}\psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi
\end{equation}
The transformation followed by the electron field and photon field is:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:qed_phase}
    \psi(x) & \rightarrow & e^{iq\chi(x)}\psi(x), \nonumber \\
    A_\mu(x) & \rightarrow & A_\mu(x) - {\partial_\mu \chi(x)}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Where the $\chi(x)$ is the arbitrary phase transformation, q is the electron-photon coupling.
And the $D_{\mu}$ given in the eq.~\ref{eq:qed_lagrangian} is known as covariant derivative and is given as:
\begin{equation}
    D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + iqA_{\mu}.
\end{equation}
Here, the photon field plays an intrinsic role without which there could be no local gauge invariance. In the construction of the local gauge invariance of QED, we realize that the local gauge invariance of a spin-half particle requires the existence of a gauge boson and their coupling with the fermions. Also, for the exact gauge invariance, the gauge bosons must be massless. 

In Eq.~\ref{eq:qed_phase}, the phase factor $e^{i\chi(x)}$ belongs to the symmetry group $U(1)$ of the unitarity transformations in one dimension. Thus, the generalization of the QED can be made to the other forces by exploring other possibilities of the symmetry group.

For example, the electrons and neutrino can be chosen as a double $(\nu_e,e)$, i.e. as two members of the same family, since both of them are spin-half particles.
Thus, it can be described as the doublet by a two-component field $\phi = (\nu_e(x),e(x))$ and imposes a gauge transformation where $\alpha$ is a $2\times 2$ hermitian matrix operating on the $\phi$.

% \subsubsection{Example: Weak Interactions} % (fold)
% \label{ssub:example_weak_interactions}
The weak interaction, SU(2), local gauge transformation can be written for the electron doublet field as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \phi (x) &  = & e^{ig_w \balpha .\boldsymbol{T}} \phi(x) \nonumber \\
             &  \simeq & (I + ig_w \balpha \boldsymbol{.T})\phi(x),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\balpha$ is the arbitrary infinitesimal vector in the isospin space and the $\bt = \{T_1,T_2,T_3\}$ is the three generators of the SU(2) symmetry group, which can be expressed using Pauli spin matrices as $\bt = \bsigma / 2$. Also, the $\bt_i$ do not commute,\begin{equation}
    [T_i,T_j] = i\epsilon_{ijk}T_k,
\end{equation} and the doublet field $\phi(x)$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = \begin{bmatrix}
        \nu_e(x)  \\
        e(x)  \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
As the generator of this group, $T_i$'s do not commute it is said to be the non-Abelian group.

Assuming the fermion mass to be zero the Lagrangian for the electron and electron-neutrino can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SU2_lag}
    \Lagr = i\bar{\phi}\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\phi = i\bar{\nu_e}\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\nu_e + i\bar{e}\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}e
\end{equation}

The $\psi$-field in the Lagrangian, Eq.~\ref{eq:SU2_lag} can be made gauge invariant by using the covariant derivative instead of derivative, which is defined using the three gauge fields given by $\bw = \{W_1,W_2,W_3\}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:su2_covarientderivative}
    \partial_{\mu} \rightarrow D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + i g_w \bw_{\mu}.\bt
\end{equation}

Also the gauge fields $\bw_{i\mu}$ transforms as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:su2_gaugefield}
    \bw_{\mu}(x) \rightarrow \bw_{\mu}(x) + \partial_{\mu}\balpha + g\balpha \times \bw_{\mu}(x)
\end{equation}

Unlike the QED (Eq.~\ref{eq:qed_phase}), the gauge field transformation in weak interaction (or SU(3) group) is complicated because of the non-Abelian property of its generator. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:SU2_lag},\ref{eq:su2_gaugefield}, and~\ref{eq:su2_covarientderivative}, we can show that the Lagrangian of weak interaction, Eq.~\ref{eq:SU2_lag}, remains gauge invariant.

Still, we need to add the kinetic term for the $W$ fields. This can be taken similar to the QED and given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:su2_kinetic}
    \Lagr_{\bw} = -\frac{1}{4}\bw_{\mu \nu}. \bw^{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:su2_kefield_exp}
    \bw_{\mu \nu} = \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} - g \bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}
\end{equation}
Here, the term $\bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}$ shows that the Lagrangian of weak interaction contains the W-boson self-interaction terms and written as
\begin{equation}
    \bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu} = \epsilon_{ijk} W^{\mu}_j W^{\nu}_k
\end{equation}
Now, using Eq.~\ref{eq:su2_kefield_exp}, Eq.~\ref{eq:su2_kinetic} becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Lagr & = & -\frac{1}{4} \Big[ \big( \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} \big) - g_w \bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu} \Big]  \Big[ \big( \partial^{\mu} \bw^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} \bw^{\mu} \big) - g_w \bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu} \Big] \nonumber \\
        & = & -\frac{1}{4} \big( \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} \big) \big( \partial^{\mu} \bw^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} \bw^{\mu} \big) \nonumber \\
        &   & + \frac{1}{4} \Big[  g_w\big( \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} \big)\bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu} \Big] + \frac{1}{4} \Big[  g_w \bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}  \big( \partial^{\mu} \bw^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} \bw^{\mu} \big)\Big] \nonumber \\
        &   & - \frac{1}{4} g_W^2 \big(\bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}\big) \big(\bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu}\big) 
\end{eqnarray}
Now, we can explicitly divide the weak interaction Lagrangian into the kinetic and interaction parts, as
\begin{equation}
    \Lagr_W = \Lagr_{kin} + \Lagr_{int},
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
    \Lagr_{kin} = -\frac{1}{4} \big( \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} \big) \big( \partial^{\mu} \bw^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} \bw^{\mu} \big) \nonumber
\end{equation}
and,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Lagr_{int} & = &  \frac{1}{4} \Big[  g_w\big( \partial_{\mu} \bw_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \bw_{\mu} \big)\bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu} \Big] + \frac{1}{4} \Big[  g_w \bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}  \big( \partial^{\mu} \bw^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} \bw^{\mu} \big)\Big] \nonumber \\
        &   & - \frac{1}{4} g_W^2 \big(\bw_{\mu} \times \bw_{\nu}\big) \big(\bw^{\mu} \times \bw^{\nu}\big) 
\end{eqnarray}
In component form it can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Lagr_{int} & = & \frac{1}{2} \Big[  g_w \epsilon_{ijk}\big( \partial_{\mu} W_{\nu i} - \partial_{\nu} W_{\mu i} \big)W^{\mu}_j \times W^{\nu}_k \Big] \nonumber \\
        &   & - \frac{1}{4} g_W^2 \epsilon_{ijk} \epsilon_{imn} W^{\mu}_j W^{\nu}_k W_{m \mu} W_{n \nu}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, the interaction part of Lagrangian shows that in weak interaction there are triple as well as quartic both types of self-couplings are allowed, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_triple_quartic}. In weak interaction, these self-couplings are the consequences of the non-Abelian nature of the SU(2) group algebra. 
In terms of the physical fields, there are two types of triple gauge couplings - $\gamma \ww$ and $Z \ww$ - and four types of quartic gauge couplings, $\ww \ww$, $\ww ZZ$, $\ww Z \gamma$ and $\ww \gamma \gamma$, which are allowed in the SM.
Here, $\w^\pm$, $Z$, and $\gamma$ are the linear combination of $W_1$, $W_2$ and $W_3$ fields, as discussed in section \ref{sub:brief_introduction_to_higgs_mechanism}.

Similarly, the other leptons and the quarks can also be put in doublets $(\nu_\mu, \mu)$, $(\nu_\tau,\tau)$, $(u,d)$, etc. and subject to the similar transformations.
Furthermore, these transformations are not only the phase factors, as the off-diagonal elements of $\chi$ can change one member of a doublet into the another as it belongs to the same symmetry group SU(2) of the unitary unimodular transformations in 2-dimensions.
And the local gauge invariance in these cases requires the introduction of three massless spin-1 gauge bosons $W^+,~W^-$ and $W^0$.
Furthermore, if it can be combined with a simultaneous U(1) symmetry it brings one more gauge boson $B^0$. This group is known as the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ gauge group, which is formulated successfully by Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg for the unification of QED and weak interaction (known as electroweak interactions)~\cite{StandardModel67_2} having massless gauge bosons. But all the gauge bosons cannot be massless. The masses of gauge bosons $W^+$, $W^-$ and $Z$ bosons has already been measured by experiments. Thus the symmetry cannot be exact. It should be broken spontaneously in such a way that it retains the renormalizable feature in such a way that it retain three massive bosons $W^+, W^-$ and $Z$ and one massless boson $\gamma$. This is explained in Sec.~\ref{sub:brief_introduction_to_higgs_mechanism}.

The subscript in the $SU(2)_L$ in the electroweak theory tells that the gauge transformation $SU(2)$ only acts on the left-handed particles\footnote{Handedness of a particle relates the spin and the direction of motion. If the direction of spin of a particle is in the direction of its motion, it is referred as \textbf{right-handed particle} else it is known as \textbf{left-handed particles}.}.
This condition is imposed since the process like the beta-decay are observed to involve the quark and leptons with left-handed spins relative to their motions.
The first generation of the spin-half particles can be classified in doublet and singlets representations of $SU(2)_L$ as below:
\begin{eqnarray}
    (u_L,d_L),(\nu_{eL},e_L),\bar{u}_L,\bar{d}_L,\bar{e}_L, \nonumber \\
    (\bar{d}_R,\bar{u}_R),(\bar{e}_R,\bar{\nu}_{eR}),u_R,d_R,e_R.   \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Furthermore, we did not find the right-handed neutrino state experimentally yet.
Thus we have 15 left-handed (and 15 right-handed) fermion states in each generation counting three colours for each quark flavour, in this gauge theory of electroweak interactions.

% <!-- %In chiral theories, where gauge bosons have different couplings to left and right handed fermion states a new problem arises- typically for the interaction of three gauge bosons via a closed loop of fermions as shown in figure
% %add figure
% %When the L and R fermion couplings are unequal at one (or three) of the vertices, as is the case in the standard electroweak theory -->

The strong interaction is described by $SU(3)$ local gauge invariance. It is described by the three-component field $\psi(x)=[\psi(red,x),\psi(blue,x),\psi(green,x)]$ having local gauge transformation $\chi$ which is a $3\times 3$ hermitian matrix operating on $\psi$, as each quark has three possible colours. To achieve the local gauge invariance this requires the introduction of eight massless gauge boson, known as gluons, which carry pairs of color labels. This gauge theory of strong interaction is known as QCD. This gauge theory combined with electroweak theory gives $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge invariant theory of strong and electroweak forces combined, becomes the Standard Model.


% With each of these gauge groups $(SU(3),SU(2)$ and $U(1))$ there is associated a characteristic coupling strength $\alpha_3,~\alpha_2,~\alpha_1$ analogous to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of electrodynamics. They are generally called the running couplings because their numerical values change logarithmically with the energy scale of the interaction due to renormalization.

% These renormalizable gauge theories allow the presence of spin 0 (scalar) particles, too~\cite{Higgs1964a,Higgs1964,Englert1964,Guralnik1964,Higgs1966,Kibble1967}. The usual formulation of the Standard Model requires at least one of these, the Higgs scalar boson, arising from the mechanism for spontaneously breaking the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ electroweak symmetry and giving masses to the weak gauge bosons and to the leptons and quarks. This mechanism is a vital part of the SM.

\subsection{Brief Introduction to Higgs Mechanism} % (fold)
\label{sub:brief_introduction_to_higgs_mechanism}
One of the main issues with the electroweak theory was that all the particles were assumed to be massless.
The mass term was not invariant under the local gauge transformation under $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ and therefore, breaks symmetry.
This issue was solved by the Higgs mechanism.
The Higgs mechanism predicts a symmetrical Higgs field having non-invariant lowest energy state. This gives mass to the fermions and boson by interacting with the Higgs field. The Higgs field can only be observed via its excitation known as the Higgs boson, H.

The electroweak theory contains $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry and the Higgs part of full Lagrangian is given by :
\begin{equation}
    L_H=(D_{\mu}\Phi)^{\dagger}(D^{\mu}\Phi)-V(\Phi)
\end{equation}
The SM Lagrangian extends the experimentally well established particle content of the SM by the complex scalar SU(2) doublet $\Phi = (\phi^{+},\phi^0)^T$ of weak hypercharge $Y_{w,\Phi}=1$, so that $\phi^{+}$ carries charge +e and $\phi^0$ is neutral. In total $\Phi$ involves four degree of freedom. The self-interaction of $\Phi$ is described by the potential
\begin{equation}
    V(\Phi)=-\mu^2(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi)+\frac{\lambda}{4}(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi)^2,
\end{equation}
Here, the term $\lambda > 0$ ensures that the potential is bounded from below. Here we need to generate masses for the three gauge bosons $W^{\pm}$ and Z but the photon should remain massless. Therefore, we need at least 3 degree of freedom for the scalar fields. The simplest choice is a complex SU(2) doublet of scalar field $\phi$:
\begin{equation}\label{mat2}
    \Phi=
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \phi^+  \\
        \phi^0  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \phi_1 + i\phi_2    \\
        \phi_3 + i\phi_4    \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_i$ are 4 real scalar fields (4 degree of freedom). The Lagrangian is invariant under the local gauge transformations \footnote{The concept of gauge invariance is fundamental in the construction of the Standard Model of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of elementary particles. The gauge principle prescribes that, given the gauge symmetry group and the transformations of the fields, the quantum field theory is uniquely defined~\cite{Coughlan2006}.}
\begin{equation}
    \Phi (x) \rightarrow \Phi(x)`=e^{i\alpha_i(x)\tau_i /2}\Phi(x)
\end{equation}
where $\tau_i$ are Pauli matrices and $\alpha_i(x)$ are transformation parameters.
Now the product
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mat1}
    \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi=
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \phi^{+*}   &   \phi^{0*} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \phi^+  \\
        \phi^0  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    =\phi^{+*} \phi^+ + \phi^{0*}\phi^0
    =\frac{1}{2}(\phi^2_1+\phi^2_2+\phi^2_3+\phi^2_4)
    =\frac{1}{2}\phi_i \phi^i
\end{equation}
    
For $\mu^2<0$, corresponds to the ``\textit{Mexican Hat}'' potential shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsPotential}, the potential $V(\Phi)$ has a minimum at
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}=\frac{v^2}{2}
\end{equation}
From equation~\ref{eq:mat1}, we know that there is an infinite number of possible solutions of this equation. To preserve electric charge conservation ($U(1)_{QED}$ symmetry), this non zero vacuum expectation value should not be reached in the charged direction. A convenient choice of the neutral direction is $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = \phi_4 = 0$. So, the equation~\ref{mat2}:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        0   \\
        \phi_3  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/Intro/higgspotential.png}
    \caption{Higgs potential~\cite{Ellis2015}}
    \label{fig:higgsPotential}
\end{figure}
Therefore, the neutral component ($\phi_3$) of the doublet field $\Phi$ develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value
\begin{equation}
    {\Braket\Phi}_0 = \Braket{0|\Phi|0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        0   \\
        v   \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        with~
        v=-
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}
        \end{bmatrix}
        ^{1/2}
\end{equation}
Now by using the unitarity gauge\footnote{It removes the unphysical degree of freedom} means of proper gauge transformation of the field we get
\begin{equation}
    \Phi (x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        0   \\
        v+h(x)  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
With $\Phi(x)$ we can expand kinetic term $D_\mu \Phi)^{\dagger} (D_\mu \Phi)=|D_\mu \Phi|^2$ of lagrangian
\begin{eqnarray}\label{mat3}
    |D_{\mu} \Phi|^2 & = & |(\partial_{\mu}-ig_2\frac{\tau_a}{2}W^a_{\mu}-ig_1 \frac{Y_H}{2}B_{\mu})\Phi|^2 \nonumber \\
            & = & \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu H)^2+\frac{1}{8}g^2_2(v+H)^2|W^1_{\mu}+iW^2_\mu|^2+\frac{1}{8}|g_2W^3_\mu-g_1B_\mu|^2
\end{eqnarray}
Lets define the new fields $W^{\pm}_\mu$ and $Z_\mu$ [$A_\mu$ is the field orthogonal to $Z_\mu$]:
\begin{equation}
    W^{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(W^1_\mu \mp iW^2_\mu),~Z_\mu=\frac{g_2W^3_\mu-g_1B_\mu}{\sqrt{g^2_2+g^2_1}},~A_\mu=\frac{g_2W^3_\mu+g_1B_\mu}{\sqrt{g^2_2+g^2_1}}
\end{equation}
Now we pick the term from equation~\ref{mat3} which are bilinear in the fields $W^\pm,Z,A$:
\begin{equation}
    M^2_wW^+_\mu W^{-\mu},~\frac{1}{2}M^2_z Z_\mu Z^\mu,~and~\frac{1}{2}M^2_AA_\mu A^\mu
\end{equation}
Then we noted that W and Z boson have acquired masses, while the photon is still massless
\begin{equation}
    M_w=\frac{1}{2}vg_2,~M_z=\frac{1}{2}v\sqrt{g^2_2+g^2_1},~M_A=0
\end{equation}
So, by spontaneously breaking the symmetry, three Goldstone bosons have been absorbed by the $W^{\pm}$ and Z boson to form their longitudinal components and to get their masses. Since the U(1) symmetry is still unbroken, the photon which is its generator, remains massless.

Thus, it is established that the Higgs mechanism generates the mass for the vector boson, So, it follows naturally.
% But for the Higgs mechanism to be validated Higgs boson should be found experimentally. In July 2012, we found a Higgs like boson. But, is it the Higgs of SM or something else we can say now because of the uncertainty and statistical error involved in the present analysis. 

% So, What are the possible ways to investigate it?

% Basically there are two possible ways to investigate it. First, we should try to study the coupling of the Higgs boson with different particle (top quark is the best candidate). Secondly, we should try to study the vector boson scattering.

\section{Vector Boson Scattering} % (fold)
\label{sec:vector_boson_scattering}
% To understand the structure of electroweak symmetry breaking, one of most important process is the study of vector boson scattering at the LHC. This includes both triple and quartic gauge couplings and the Higgs channels. In the VBS process the initial quarks emits the gauge bosons which interacts with each other and decay afterwards. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{}.
As discussed in the previous section, the VBS is one of the important measurements to be performed at the LHC. It is known that the VBS includes both triple and quartic gauge coupling. In VBS, the radiated gauge bosons by quarks from the two protons and interact with each other and decay afterwards. The Feynman diagram corresponding to the VBS is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:VBF_vv_vv}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Pictures/VBF_VV_VV.png}
    \caption{VBS diagram}
    \label{fig:VBF_vv_vv}
\end{figure}

There are several different ways by which the gauge bosons can interact via a quartic vertices or exchange of $Z$ or $\gamma$ or $W$ or a Higgs boson. This is shown using the Feynman diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:VBF_vv_all}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.20\textwidth,height=3cm]{figures/Intro/VV_Scattering_diagrams_1.png}%

    \caption{All possible VBS diagrams.}
    \label{fig:VBF_vv_all}
\end{figure}

Vector Boson Scattering requires six weak vertices, so it is a $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6_W)$ process with a small cross section compared to most of the processes observed at the LHC. Another difficulty is that we could not generate only $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6_W)$ process for VBS alone from any available generator in a gauge invariant way. Along with the VBS diagrams it contains lots of other Feynman diagrams, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:non-vbs}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Pictures/non-vbs.png}

% \end{figure}


One of the important signatures of VBS are the two jets in the forward pseudo-rapidity region, called as tagging jets, resulting from the quark emitting the gauge bosons. Thus, the pseudo-rapidity between the tagging jets is expected to be large.

Furthermore, there are different modes of decay of w-bosons like $WW \rightarrow l \nu l\nu $, $WW \rightarrow jj jj $, and $WW \rightarrow l \nu jj$. The leptonic channel is considered to have less background specially if working with same sign W-bosons but it has very less cross-section than semi-leptonic or fully hadronic. While the fully hadronic channel has comparatively larger cross-section but it suffers from huge QCD background. Thus, one of best ways to work with semi-leptonic channel is that it has larger branching fraction than fully leptonic and comparatively lesser background than fully-hadronic, for which the analysis was performed and the details are given in Chapter~\ref{cha:anomalous_quartic_gauge_coupling_measurement}.

\section{Anomalous Quartic Gauge Coupling} % (fold)
\label{sec:anomalous_quartic_gauge_coupling}
The SM has been found to be in good agreement with experimental results but it is quite possible that the SM is correct only up to an unknown centre of mass energy scale $\Lambda$.
Thus, it is possible that the new effect or completely new physics lie above this scale but the sign of it can be observed indirectly at the currently accessible energy.
One of the possible ways to detect these signs is to build an Effective Field Theory (EFT) to parametrize the effects of high energy scale effect on the energy scale available to us. This introduces new degree of freedom to the SM.

The new effective Lagrangian using the EFT is
% \begin{equation}
%     \Lagr_{eff} = \Lagr_{SM} + \sum_{d>4} \sum_i{\frac{c_i^{(d)}}{\Lambda^{d-4}}\mathcal{O}_i^{d}},
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Lagr_{eff} = \Lagr_{SM} + \sum_{i=www,w,B, \phi W, \phi B} \frac{c_i}{\Lambda^2} {\Oo}_i + \sum_{j=0,1}\frac{f_{S,j}}{\Lambda^4} \Oo_{S,j} + \sum_{j=0,...,9}\frac{f_{T,j}}{\Lambda^4} \Oo_{T,j}  + \sum_{j=0,...,7}\frac{f_{M,j}}{\Lambda^4} \Oo_{M,j} ,
\end{equation}
here, $\Lambda$ is the new physics scale, the parameter $c_i$, is the dimensionless coupling-strength coefficient of order $\Oo(1)$ and $f_{s,j}$, $f_{T,j}$ and $f_{M,j}$ are for the dimensionless coupling-strength coefficient for the quartic gauge couplings. Also, in EFT at $\Lambda \rightarrow \inf$ the effective Lagrangian should reduce to the SM one.

Due to higher dimension these operators $\mathcal{O}$ have coefficients of inverse power of mass so the operators with the lowest dimension are dominant. Most of the SM operators are of dimension four and since only operators with even dimension satisfy conservation of lepton and baryon number the new operators have to be at least dimension six operators~\cite{Degrande2013a}. 
These new operators effect also double and triple gauge boson couplings; these can be studied more easily in other processes. \todo[inline]{Rewrite this para...}.

Dimension eight operators have no effects in double or triple couplings so they have to be searched for in quartic gauge couplings. Vector Boson Scattering allows these examinations of these couplings. In general the following are the possible operators for the quartic gauge boson vertex:

\subsubsection{Operators containing only $D_\mu \phi$} % (fold)
\label{ssub:operators_containing_only_}
In this category there are two independent operators. They are:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathcal{O}_{S,0}=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}\times D_{\nu}\phi) \Big]\times \Big[(D^{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}D^{\nu}\phi \Big], \\
    \mathcal{O}_{S,1}=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}\times D^{\mu}\phi)\Big]\times \Big[(D_{\nu}\phi)^{\dagger} D^{\nu}\phi\Big],
\end{eqnarray}
where the Higgs covariant derivative is given as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:covarient_derivative_qgc}
     D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i\frac{g'}{2}B_\mu + ig_w W^i_{\mu} \frac{T^i}{2}
 \end{equation} 
 and the field strength tensors of the $SU(2)_L$ $(W^i_\mu)$ and $U(1)_Y$  $(B_\mu)$ gauge fields are given as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:fieldstrength_qgc}
    W_{\mu \nu} = \frac{i}{2}g T^i (\partial_\mu W^i_\nu - \partial_\nu W^i_\mu + g \epsilon_{ijk} W^j_\mu W^k_\nu) \\
    B_{\mu \nu} = \frac{i}{2} g' (\partial B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu)
\end{eqnarray}
The operators $\Oo_{S,0}$ and $\Oo_{S,1}$ contains the quartic gauge coupling for process $\ww \ww$, $\ww \zz$ and $\zz \zz$ interactions which do not depend on the gauge boson momenta. 
% subsubsection operators_containing_only_ (end)

\subsubsection{Operators containing $D_{\mu}\phi$ and two field strength tensors} % (fold)
\label{ssub:operators_containing_}
The quartic gauge coupling is also generated by using the two electroweak field strength tensors and two covariant derivatives of the Higgs doublet as:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{O}_{M,0} &=Tr\Big[W_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}\Big]\times \Big[(D_{\beta}\phi)^{\dagger}D^{\beta}\phi\Big] \\
\mathcal{O}_{M,1} &=Tr\Big[W_{\mu\nu}W^{\nu\beta}\Big]\times \Big[(D_{\beta}\phi)^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\phi\Big]\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,2} &=\Big[B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}\Big]\times \Big[(D_{\beta}\phi)^{\dagger}D^{\beta}\phi\Big]\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,3} &=\Big[B_{\mu\nu}B^{\nu\beta}\Big]\times \Big[(D_{\beta}\phi)^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\phi\Big]\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,4} &=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}W_{\beta\nu}D^{\mu}\phi\Big]\times B^{\beta\nu}\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,5} &=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}W_{\beta\nu}D^{\nu}\phi\Big]\times B^{\beta\mu}\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,6} &=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}W_{\beta\nu}W^{\beta\nu}D^{\mu}\phi\Big]\\
\mathcal{O}_{M,7} &=\Big[(D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}W_{\beta\nu}W^{\beta\nu}D^{\mu}\phi\Big]
\end{align}
Here, the field strength tensors $W_{\mu \nu}$ and $B_{\mu \nu}$ is defined as Eq.~\ref{eq:fieldstrength_qgc}. This class of operators of the quartic gauge-boson interaction depends on the vector boson momenta due to the presence of the field strength tensors.

\halfblankline
\subsubsection{Operators containing only field strength tensors} % (fold)
\label{ssub:operators_containing_only_field_strength_tensors}
In this class only the field strength tensors lead to the anomalous quartic couplings, which is given by following operators:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{O}_{T,0} &=Tr\Big[W_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}\Big]\times Tr\Big[W_{\alpha\beta}W^{\alpha\beta}\Big]\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,1} &=Tr\Big[W_{\alpha\nu}W^{\mu\beta}\Big]\times Tr\Big[W_{\mu\beta}W^{\alpha\nu}\Big]\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,2} &=Tr\Big[W_{\alpha\mu}W^{\mu\beta}\Big]\times Tr\Big[W_{\beta\nu}W^{\nu\alpha}\Big]\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,5} &=Tr\Big[W_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}\Big]\times B_{\alpha\beta}B^{\alpha\beta}\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,6} &=Tr\Big[W_{\alpha\nu}W^{\mu\beta}\Big]\times B_{\mu\beta}B^{\alpha\nu}\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,7} &=Tr\Big[W_{\alpha\mu}W^{\mu\beta}\Big]\times B_{\beta\nu}B^{\nu\alpha}\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,8} &=B_{\nu\mu}B^{\nu\mu}B_{\alpha\beta}B^{\alpha\beta}\\
    \mathcal{O}_{T,9} &=B_{\alpha\mu}B^{\mu\beta}B_{\beta\nu}B^{\nu\alpha}
\end{align}
The last two operators $\mathcal{O}_{T,8}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{T,9}$ are the operators which contain only neutral electroweak gauge bosons.
The list of all quartic vertices modified by all the dimension-8 operators are listed in Table~\ref{table:aQGC_alloperator}.


In this thesis, the aQGC study is performed in channel $pp\rightarrow W^{\pm}Vjj$ and $pp \rightarrow ZVjj$, where V could be W-boson or the Z-boson which is only allowed to decay hadronically and the other boson is allowed to decay leptonic. This channel, WV and ZV (specially, the $W^\pm W^\pm$ and $W^\pm Z$) fusion channels are also of interest because they are involved during the production and decay of a heavy, singly or doubly charged Higgs boson. Thus, these channel also provide us the means of study the couplings of type $W^\pm Z H^\pm$ and $H^{\pm \pm}W^\pm W^\pm$~\cite{Vega1990}. In this thesis the singly and doubly charged Higgs are considered in the framework of a specific model suggested by Georgi and Machacek~\cite{GEORGI1985463} which is described in next section.

Also, a constraint from the electroweak parameter, $\rho$, also known as ``\textit{Custodial Symmetry}'', is imposed by the global $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry upon the scalar potential. The parameter $\rho$ is given as
\begin{equation}
    \rho = \frac{M_W}{M_Z ~ cos(\theta)} = 1,
\end{equation}
where, $\theta$ is the weak mixing angle.
An isospin doublet of the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ is given as

        (\chi^0)^*     &   \zeta^+     &   \chi^{++} \\

        (\chi^{++})^*  &   (-\zeta^+)^*   &   \chi^0    \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The vacuum expectation values (vev) for the $\Phi$
\begin{equation}
    \Braket{\Phi} = \frac{V_\phi}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbb{1}_{2\times 2}
\end{equation}
and for the field $X$ is 
\begin{equation}
    \Braket{X}  = v_x \mathbb{1}_{3\times 3}
\end{equation}
where, $\mathbb{1}$ is the unit matrix and the W and Z boson to be massless provides a condition that

\begin{equation}
    v_\phi^2 + 8v_{\chi}^2 = v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}G_F} \approx (246~GeV)^2
\end{equation}

The most general gauge invariant potential involving these fields that preserve the custodial symmetry is given as
\begin{eqnarray}
    V{\Phi,X} & = & \frac{\mu_2^2}{2}Tr(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi) + \frac{\mu_3^2}{2}Tr(X^{\dagger}X)  \nonumber \\
            & & + \lambda_1\Big[ Tr(\phi^\dagger \phi)\Big] + \lambda_2 Tr\Big[ (\phi^{\dagger} \phi) Tr(X^{\dagger}X) \Big] \nonumber \\

where $\tau^a = \frac{\sigma^a}{2}$,

        \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}\

The physical fields generated can be organized by the transformation properties under the custodial SU(2) symmetry into pentaplet and a triplet and two singlets. They are:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{Pentaplet}~:&   & H^{++}_5 = \chi^{++} \\
                        &   & H^+_5 = \frac{\chi^+ - \zeta^+}{\sqrt{2}} \\
                        &   & H^0_5 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\zeta^{0,r} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\chi^{0,r} \\
                        &   & \\
    \mathbf{Triplet}~:  &   & H^+_3 = -S_H \phi^+ + C_H \frac{\chi^++X^+}{\sqrt{2}} \\
                        &   & H^0_3 = -S_H \phi^{0,i} + C_H \chi^{0,i} \\
                        &   & \\
    \mathbf{Singlet}~:  &   & H^0_1 = \phi^{0,r}\\
                        &   & H^{0'}_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\zeta^{0,r} + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \chi^{0,r},
\end{eqnarray}
where,
\begin{eqnarray}
    S_H = sin(\theta_H) = \frac{2\sqrt{2} v_\chi}{v} \\
    C_H = cos(\theta_H) = \frac{v_\phi}{v}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, within the pentaplets and the triplets, the masses are degenerated at the tree level and are given in terms of the parameters of scalar potential by
\begin{eqnarray}
    m_5^2 & = & \frac{M_1}{4v_\chi} v_{\phi}^2 + 12 M_2 v_{\chi} + \frac{3}{2}\lambda_5 v^2_{\phi} + 8 \lambda_3 v_{\chi}^2 \\
    m_3^2 & = & \frac{M_1}{4v_\chi} v^2 + \frac{\lambda_5}{2} v^2 
\end{eqnarray}
The two custodial singlets will  mix by an angle $\alpha$ to give the two mass eigenstate $h$ and $H$,
\begin{eqnarray}
    h & = & C_{\alpha} H^0_1 - S_{\alpha} H^{0'}_1 \\
    H & = & S_{\alpha} H^0_1 + C_{\alpha} H^{0'}_1
\end{eqnarray}
where, $C_{\alpha} = cos(\alpha)$ and $S_{\alpha} = sin(\alpha)$. The mixing is controlled by the mass matrix
\begin{equation}
    M^2 = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            M_{11}^2 & M^2_{12} \\
            M_{12}^2 & M^2_{22} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{eqnarray}
    M^2_{11} & = & 8 \lambda_1 v^2_{\phi} \\
    M^2_{12} & = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_{\phi} \Big[-M_1 + 4(2\lambda_2 - \lambda_5) v_x \Big] \\
    M^2_{22} & = & \frac{M_1}{4 v_{\chi}}v^2_{\phi} - 6 M_2 v_{\chi} + 8(\lambda_3 + 3\lambda_4) v^2_{\chi}
\end{eqnarray}

A remarkable feature of the GM model is that the $HWW$ and $HZZ$ coupling may be larger than in the SM. 
The pentaplet Higgs bosons have coupling with the weak bosons while the triplet do not. Thus, the triplet Higgs bosons are said to be gauge-phobic while the pentaplets are known as Fermi-phobic.
% The custodial pentaplets have no doublet component and hence they are fermifobic at the tree level.
But these pentaplets can couple to the massive vector boson where the coupling strength is proportional to the parameter $S_H$.

The current thesis is based on the hardware activities and physics analysis performed during the course of my Ph.D. The layout of the thesis is as follows:


The current chapter begins with a brief introduction to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, followed by a prelude to the main thesis topic, i.e. triple or quartic gauge couplings. A mathematical framework is discussed to explain the generation of triple/quartic gauge couplings in the SM, followed by the brief introduction of the Higgs mechanism and the anomalous triple and quartic gauge interactions based on the approach of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on the doubly charged Higgs model, i.e., Georgi-Machacek model.

\textbf{Chapter 2} basically discusses the experimental apparatus used to collect the data for the physics studies reported in this thesis. This contains a description of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{LHC-tdr-vol2,LHC-tdr-vol3,LHC-tdr-vol1} and its one of the two general purpose detectors, i.e. the CMS detector~\cite{paper:JINST:CMSCollaboration}. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle accelerator and collider, located in a 27 km long tunnel, about 100 m underground at Swiss-France border. Currently, the LHC is operating at 13 TeV center of mass energy with peak luminosity, $\mathcal{L}~=~2.1 \times 10^{34}~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$~\cite{cms-lumi-public-results,Muratori2006}. Also, different sub-detector components of the CMS detector and their working mechanisms are outlined. The trigger system being used in the CMS detector for the data collection is also discussed which consists of the two-tier trigger. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger consists of custom hardware process running synchronously with the LHC bunch crossing frequency of 40 $MHz$. This uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors only to select the most interesting events within the time interval of less than 4 $\mu s$. The second level trigger is known as the High-Level Trigger (HLT). This uses fast offline reconstruction algorithm that uses information from all sub-systems, i.e., calorimeters, muon system as well as tracker to decide to keep or reject the event. This step further decreases the event rate from around 100 $kHz$ to about 100 $Hz$, before data storage.

\textbf{Chapter 3} is devoted to the hardware activities carried out for the CMS muon detector system upgrade. Starting from a brief history of the gaseous detectors, the focus is shifted to the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors which is one of the excellent gaseous detectors having unprecedented spatial resolution, larger sensitive/detection area, with higher rate capability and good operational stability over the longer operating periods. This detector is approved by the CMS collaboration for the upgrade of the CMS muon endcap system during Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2020). This upgrade project is named as GE1/1 upgrade, where the letter ``G'' stands for GEM, ``E'' stands for End-cap, the first ``1'' corresponds to the first muon station and the second ``1'' corresponds to the first ring of the station~\cite{Colaleo:2021453}. The proposed design and configuration of these GEM detectors are discussed along with their working principle. For observing the performance of the prototype of GEM in the real environment the GE1/1 detector was tested in several beam tests. This thesis describes the details and results from the 2014 beam test in terms of measured efficiency, time resolution and cluster size. In this beam test we tested the GE1/1 detector with both gases $Ar:CO_2$ and $Ar:CO_2:CF_4$. One of important conclusion that we can operate our detector without using the $CF_4$ gas, which is non-eco friendly, without compromising with the efficiency and the time resolution of $>98\%$ and $5-7~ns$ respectively.

Also, this thesis contains the characterization studies of the GEM foil developed in India. An Indian company, Micropack Pvt. Ltd., got the technology of GEM foil production through the Transfer of Technology (TOT) agreement with CERN. After several trials, Micropack successfully produced the $10~cm~\times~10~cm$ GEM foils using the double mask technique~\cite{DEOLIVEIRA2009}. This GEM foil is characterized by using the optical and electrical method. The results are mentioned in terms of the defects and the leakage current in GEM foil that we observed about $0.13\%$ and < 5 nA at 600 V, respectively.


\textbf{Chapter 4} reports the various steps and procedures followed in the analysis for the Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings (aQGC) measurement using the model independent way using the Effective Field Theory (EFT) for the dimension-eight operators with the data collected during 2016 (36 $fb^{-1}$) in the proton-proton collision at 13 TeV by the CMS detector. Among all the allowed processes, the process $pp \rightarrow WV jj$ and $pp \rightarrow ZV jj$ is used for the study. Here V denotes for W or Z boson and it always decay hadronically. The other vector boson in channel decays leptonically. The study starts with measuring the interference between the electroweak process $pp \rightarrow VV jj$ and the QCD initiated process. The study showed that we have less than 1\% interference between the two. The major background $W+jets$ was estimated in a data-driven way using the alpha-ratio method. The events are selected by requiring two jets with large rapidity separation having large di-jet invariant mass, one or two leptons (electrons or muons), and a boosted W or Z boson decaying hadronically. The hadronically decaying W/Z boson is reconstructed as one large radius jet having radius parameter 0.8. Finally, the limits on the dimension-eight operators are given using the frequentist approach in asymptotic approximation.


\textbf{Chapter 5} provides a summary of the work done during this PhD thesis for the physics analysis and the hardware work on the GE1/1 upgrade along with the lab development and the characterization of the GEM foil at the University of Delhi, India using the Indian made GEM foil. Also, this discusses the future prospects of physics and hardware upgrade.
