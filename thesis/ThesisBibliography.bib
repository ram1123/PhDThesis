  abstract  = {More evidence has now been collected at the Large Hadron Collider suggesting the new 125–126 GeV boson is likely the long-sought Higgs boson in the standard model. One pressing question theorists continue to ask is whether this Higgs boson is a lone player responsible for the full electroweak symmetry breaking. Current data still allow room for additional Higgs bosons or some other UV physics that may play a partial role in electroweak symmetry breaking as well. We use the $WW$ scattering to investigate such a possibility, using the two-Higgs-doublet model as a prototype. The WW scattering becomes strong when the extra Higgs bosons are very heavy. We study the sensitivity of these strong WW scattering signals at the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider.},

Beam-beam related effects not only have been extensively observed and recorded, but have also shaped the operation of the LHC for high-intensity proton running in a number of ways: the construction of the filling scheme, the choice of luminosity levelling techniques, measures to mitigate instabilities, and the choice of settings for improving performance (e.g. to reduce losses), among others.},

  abstract = {This thesis studies a possible futur implementation of a betatron tune measure- ment in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at European organization for nuclear research (CERN) using a General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) to analyse data acquired with the LHC transverse transverse damper (ADT). The present hardware and future possible implementations using ADT acquisi- tions and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) computing are described. The ADT data have to be processed to extract the betatron tune. To compute the tune, the signal is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on GPUs. We show that it is possible to achieve one order of magnitude faster FFTs on a Fermi generation GPU than what can be done using a i7 generation Central Processing Unit (CPU). This makes online per bunch FFT computation and betatron tune measurement possible.},
