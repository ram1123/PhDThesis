% As the saying goes, good premises do not entail good stories. 
It is a matter of immense pleasure to pen down these lines to express my sincere thanks to the people who have bestowed upon me their loving blessings and the heart pledged support because of which I am able to stand where I am today.

First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my PhD supervisor Dr Md. Naimuddin, for accepting me as a student. I could not have imagined having a better supervisor and mentor for my PhD study, who not only guided me for the research work but also taught me a lot about life, how to work with different people in a group/collaboration and many more.

Besides him, my sincere thanks also go to our group professors - Dr. Ashutosh Bhardwaj, Dr. Ashok Kumar, Prof. Brajesh Choudhury and Prof. Kirti Ranjan for their guidance and discussion during my PhD study.
