It is a pleasure to pen down these lines to express my sincere thanks to the people who have bestowed upon me their loving blessings and the heart pledged support because of which I am able to stand where I am today writing this thesis and working with the   best place of the experimental high energy physics studying the fundamental questions that are in front of us today.

First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my PhD supervisor Dr Md. Naimuddin, for accepting me as a student. I could not have imagined having a better supervisor and mentor for my PhD study, who not only guided me for the research work but also teach me a lot about life, how to work with different peoples in a group/collaboration and many more. However, sometimes I made him unhappy because of my poor performance during my Ph.D. period.

Besides him, I would like to thank our group professors Dr Ashutosh Bhardwaj, Dr Ashok Kumar, Prof. Brajesh Choudhury and Prof. Kirti Ranjan for their guidance and discussion during my PhD study.

Along with this, I would like to thank Dr Archana Sharma, Dr Dan Green, Dr Jeffrey Berryhill for their helpful discussion and support during my thesis work.

I would like to thank INDIA-CMS collaboration for providing us with a platform to discuss our work by arranging regular Collaboration meetings. 

This research work has been carried out based on the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and University of Delhi lab, my endeavour in research got boosted due to the excellent academic, cordial and conversant atmosphere prevailing in these two places. I would like to thank the whole CMS collaboration, the scientists, and technical and the administrative staff at the LHC accelerator complex and the CMS experiment. A special word of thanks goes to my seniors Dr Arun Kumar, Dr Ajay Gupta and Dr Varun Sharma. I am extremely grateful for their enormous support during the early stages of my PhD They enriched my understanding of the subject to a great extent.

I am thankful to the lab staff Md Yunus, Amir Hussain, Sanjay at the University of Delhi who contributed directly or indirectly throughout this research work. I gratefully acknowledge the financial support received from DAE-DST and UGC during the entire period of my research work.

I am lucky enough to have been given the supportive gift of amazing people in my life, without all of whom, this work would not have been completed. I would like to thank my seniors and colleagues at our research laboratory at the University of Delhi, Dr Daljeet Kaur, Dr Shivali Malhotra, Geetika Jain, Sumit Keshri, Aashiq Shah, Aman Phogat, Asar Ahmed, Mohit Gola, Priyanka Phogat, Arjun Chettri, Prajesh Sharma, Mohd. Rafiq, Rizwan and Hemant. I can’t express how much I’ve learned and enjoyed working with all of you during the last six years. Also, I would like to thank my other friends from CMS collaboration Ankita Mehta, Anterpreet Kaur, Ridhi Chawla, Dr Archie Sharma.
I am happy to acknowledge Ankita Mehta for being dear friends of mine. She helped me a lot during this thesis writing. She critically reviewed this thesis and her valuable suggestions helped me a lot to improve it, without her help I might not able to improve the content of the thesis. Along with Ankita, Ankit Gaur, Geetika Jain, Sumit Keshri, Arjun Chettri and Dr Archie Sharma helped me a lot during this thesis writing.

I would also like to thank my some of school and college friend Sunil Pandey, Rajesh Patel, Vijay Bhatt, Ved Prakash, Dinesh Kumar Verma, Ramesh Sharma, Nitika Mangala, Sumit Kumar, Dheeraj Chandwani. I thank them for numerous cheerful and unforgettable moments we have shared. 

I would like to special thank Sumit Kumar for being my roommate for three years. His continuous admiration, support and trust have always helped me maintain my confidence level and given me the morale boost to overcome the hurdles of my life. Thanks a lot for teaching me what friendship is all about. You will always be the brother of my soul and the friend of my heart.

I would like to thank my wife Archana for helping, caring during this thesis and helping me with the thesis writing. She always supported me with my writing. Also, I would like to thank my brother-in-law Dr Arvind Kumar for supporting and giving me his grammatical comments during my thesis writing.


First, I would like to acknowledge my parents. I do not have words to express my obligation for them. They always supported me through this journey. I very much remember with gratitude my mother and father, who played a big role in shaping me, what I am today, with their continuous counselling and suggestions, sometimes with love and sometimes with a scold. I remember the blessings and affections of all my relatives and well-wishers since my childhood which has contributed in shaping up my life and career. I owe my knowledge and desire to learn more to all my respected teachers. Some of my teacher who inspired me at the different stages of my life are Manju Sharma, Mani Shankar Pandey, Dr. Arijit Choudhury, Dr. Manisha Verma, Dr. Sanjeeta Gupta and Prof. Vinay Gupta.

Also, I very much indebted to sir Sarita vihar without his help I am unable to write this thesis. He teaches me in my class XI and XII without any tuition fee as my parents could not afford the tuition fee at that time. He is the one who developed the foundation of science in me. I think because of him I felt comfortable in Science and started a further carrier in Physics.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the most compassionate and merciful God Almighty for giving me the strength, courage, ability and opportunity to undertake this research study and to accomplish it.\\[3.0cm]
