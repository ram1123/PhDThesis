In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, masses for the particles are generated by the Higgs mechanism, which requires the existence of a spin-0 particle called the Higgs boson. In July 2012, a new Higgs like particle is discovered with mass 125-126 GeV at the LHC. This may be the long sought Higgs boson of the standard model (SM), which was proposed in 1960s, or one of the Higgs bosons beyond the SM. For example, super-symmetric theories, little-Higgs models, and other extended Higgs sector such as the Georgi-Machacek model all contain a multitude of neutral as well as charged Higgs bosons. Because, the current data still contain large uncertainties that these various extensions of the SM cannot be confirmed or ruled out decisively. So, It is important to at-least constraint the various couplings of the Higgs boson, based on the signal strength of all decay channels of the Higgs boson. One of the most useful constraints from the global fitting of the Higgs boson couplings is the one to a pair of W/Z bosons.
% The current data constrain
% 	\begin{equation}
% 	C_v = \frac{g_{hWW}}{g_{hWW}^{SM}} = 0.96^{+0.13}_{-0.15}
% 	\end{equation}
% The central value is close to 1, which means that the observed Higgs boson leaves only little room for the existence of another Higgs boson or some unknown unitarity violation (UV) physics responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). If $C_v$ is exactly equal to 1, it means that the observed Higgs boson will completely account for the EWSB. We do not need another Higgs boson, or if it exists it has nothing to do with the EWSB.

% If the hWW coupling is less than its SM value, there must be something heavier, could be as heavy as a few TeV, to complete the EWSB. 
% In particular, through proton-proton collisions it is expected to shed light on the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. 

% In the SM of particle physics, masses for the particles are generated by the Higgs mechanism, which requires the existence of a spin-0 particle called the Higgs boson. This particle is discovered now at approx. 125 GeV but it is not sure that it is the Higgs boson which is responsible for the EWSB.

% It is possible that the Higgs boson does not exist. In the SM without Higgs boson, the tree level amplitude for longitudinal vector boson scattering $V_LV_L\rightarrow V_LV_L$ violates unitarity at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.2 TeV. New physics, perhaps accompanied by new particles, must appear at or before this scale. It will therefore be crucial to measure vector boson (W or Z) scattering up to the highest possible energies either as a search for the new physics or as confirmation that our understanding of any new physics found in other channels is correct.
