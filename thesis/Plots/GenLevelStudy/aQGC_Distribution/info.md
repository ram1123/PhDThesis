1. All distribution compares SM with different aQGC points.

1. All distributions are normalized to unity.

1. No cuts are applied to the distribution.

These distributions are plotted with macro: https://github.com/osWW-VBS/GEN-SIM-analyzer/blob/LHEonlyMiniAOD/GenAnalyzer/PlottingCodes/Plot_aQGC.py
