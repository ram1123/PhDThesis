\chapter*{Synopsis}
In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, masses of the particles are generated by the Higgs mechanism which require the existence of a spin-0 particle~\cite{Higgs1964,Higgs1964a,Higgs1966,Englert1964,Kibble1967,Guralnik1964} called the Higgs boson. In July 2012, a new Higgs-like particle, with mass $\approx$125 GeV, was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This might be the long-sought SM Higgs boson predicted in the 1960s, or one of the Higgs bosons predicted by the several beyond the SM scenarios. Several beyond SM scenarios, such as, super-symmetry, little-Higgs models, and others from the extended Higgs sectors such as the Georgi-Machacek model~\cite{GEORGI1985463}, contain a multitude of neutral as well as charged Higgs bosons. Till now the existing results contain large uncertainties, thus various extensions of the SM cannot be confirmed or ruled out precisely.
This necessitates to scrutinize, the ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) mechanism rigorously by carrying out the precision measurements of the Higgs boson properties and the couplings of the electroweak vector bosons (W and Z) with the Higgs boson via the Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) processes.

VBS processes violate the unitarity at an energy scale $\approx$1 TeV in the absence of the Higgs boson. Thus, this is one of the most important studies that could help us to understand the EWSB mechanism. Due to statistical constraints, VBS could be probed indirectly by measuring the quartic vertices. In this thesis anomalous quartic gauge coupling (aQGC) measurement is reported using the model independent way using the Effective Field Theory (EFT) by parametrizing the effects of high energy effects on the enregy scale available to us~\cite{aqgc_operators}. The new effective lagrangin using the EFT is give as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{eff} = \mathcal{L}_{SM} + \sum_{i=www,w,B, \phi W, \phi B} \frac{c_i}{\Lambda^2} {\mathcal{O}}_i + \sum_{j=0,1}\frac{f_{S,j}}{\Lambda^4} \mathcal{O}_{S,j} + \sum_{j=0,...,9}\frac{f_{T,j}}{\Lambda^4} \mathcal{O}_{T,j}  + \sum_{j=0,...,7} \frac{f_{M,j}}{\Lambda^4} \mathcal{O}_{M,j}
\end{equation}
here, $\Lambda$ is the scale of new Physics, the parameters $c_i$, $f_{S,j}$, $f_{T,j}$ and $f_{M,j}$ are the dimension less coupling-strenght coefficient typically of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. In the above equation the dimension eight operators have only quartic couplings. There are total of 18 independent paremeters that are shown in Table~\ref{table:aQGC_alloperator} out of them we measure 9 paraemeters they are: $f_{S,0}$, $f_{S,1}$, $f_{M,0}$, $f_{M,1}$, $f_{M,6}$, $f_{M,7}$, $f_{T,0}$, $f_{T,1}$ and $f_{T,2}$.

This measurement was done using the proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of $35.9~fb^{-1}$, collected using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN LHC in 2016.

The aQGC measurement is performed using two channels: WV and ZV (here, V could be either a W or a Z boson) in association with the two jets produced in forward pseudo-rapidity regions. For the WV (ZV) channels, only leptonic decays of W (Z) bosons are considered, while the V decays hadronically into jet having large radii (having radius parameter 0.8). The events are selected by requiring two jets at large rapidity separation having large di-jet invariant mass, one or two leptons (electrons or muons), a fat jet with large radii and missing transverse momentum. Constraints are imposed on the quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of dimension-eight effective field theory operators at 95\% confidence level (CL).

Furthermore, a theoretical interpretation of the observed results is given using the Georgi-Machacek model~\cite{GEORGI1985463}. This model predicts the existence of doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons using the Higgs triplets. The main feature of this model is that it preserves the custodial symmetry and provides neutrino with a Majorana mass. The exclusion limits on the production cross-section for the charged Higgs bosons times the branching fraction at 95\% CL as a function of the mass of the charged Higgs boson are reported in this thesis.

On the hardware front, work performed for the upgrade studies of the CMS detector's muon endcap system is reported. For the CMS muon endcap detector system upgrade, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors are proposed to be installed during the Long Shutdown-2 (2019-2020) period because of its excellent performance in the harsh running environment like LHC. To test the functionality of these GEM detectors, several beam tests were carried out to measure their properties and evaluate their performance in terms of spatial and timing resolution, cluster size and efficiency measurements. The outcome from these beam test campaigns and the data analysis for the GEM detectors are presented here. Also, the characterisation studies for the GEM foils developed in India for the first time are also described.

This thesis is organized in five Chapters. A brief description of each of these chapters is provided below:

\textbf{Chapter 1} begins with a brief introduction to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, followed by a prelude to the main thesis topic, i.e. triple or quartic gauge couplings. A mathematical framework is discussed to explain the generation of triple/quartic gauge couplings in the SM, followed by the brief introduction of the Higgs mechanism and the anomalous triple and quartic gauge interactions based on the approach of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on the doubly charged Higgs model, i.e., Georgi-Machacek model.

\textbf{Chapter 2} basically discusses the experimental apparatus used to collect the data for the physics studies reported in this thesis. This contains a description of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{LHC-tdr-vol2,LHC-tdr-vol3,LHC-tdr-vol1} and its one of the two general purpose detectors, i.e. the CMS detector~\cite{paper:JINST:CMSCollaboration}. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle accelerator and collider, loacated in a 27 km long tunnel, about 100 m underground at Swiss-France border. Currently, the LHC is operating at 13 TeV center of mass energy with peak luminosity, $\mathcal{L}~=~2.1 \times 10^{34}~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$~\cite{cms-lumi-public-results,Muratori2006}. Also, different sub-detector components of the CMS detector and their working mechanisms are outlined. The trigger system being used in the CMS detector for the data collection is also discussed which consists of the two-tier trigger. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger is consists of custom hardware process running synchronously with the LHC bunch crossing frequency of 40 $MHz$. This uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors only to select the most interesting events within the time interval of less than 4 $\mu s$. The second level trigger is known as the High-Level Trigger (HLT). This uses fast offline reconstruction algorithm that uses information from all sub-system, i.e., calorimeters, muon system as well as tracker to decide to keep or reject the event. This step further decrease the event rate from around 100 $kHz$ to about 100 $Hz$, before data storage.

\textbf{Chapter 3} is devoted to the hardware activities carried out for the CMS muon detector system upgrade. Starting from a brief history of the gaseous detectors, the focus is shifted to the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors which is one of excellent gaseous detector having unprecedented spatial resolution, larger sensitive/detection area, with higher rate capability and good operational stability over the longer operating periods. This detector is approved by the CMS collaboration for the upgrade of the CMS muon endcap system during Long Shut-down 2 (2019-2020). This upgrade project is named as GE1/1 upgrade, where the letter ``G'' stands for GEM, ``E'' stands for End-cap, the first ``1'' corresponds to the first muon station and the second ``1'' corresponds to the first ring of the station~\cite{Colaleo:2021453}. The proposed design and configuration of these GEM detectors are discussed along with their working principle. For observing the performance of the prototype of GEM in the real enviornment the GE1/1 detector was tested in several beam test. This theis described the details and results from the 2014 beam test in terms of measured efficiency, time resolution and cluster size. In this beam test we tested the GE1/1 detector with both gases $Ar:CO_2$ and $Ar:CO_2:CF_4$. One of important conclusion that we can operate our detector without using the $CF_4$ gas, which is non-eco friendly, without compromising with the efficiency and the time resolution of $>98\%$ and $5-7~ns$ respectively.

Also, this thesis contains the characterization studies of the GEM foil developed in India. An Indian company, Micropack Pvt. Ltd., got the technology of GEM foil production through the Transfer of Technology (TOT) agreement with CERN. It successfully able to produced the $10~cm~\times~10~cm$ GEM foils using the double mask technique~\cite{DEOLIVEIRA2009}. This GEM foil is characterized using the optical and electrical method. The results are mentioned in terms of the defects and the leakage current in GEM foil that we observed about $0.13\%$ and < 5 nA at 600 V, respectively.


\textbf{Chapter 4} reports the various steps and procedures followed in the analysis for the Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings (aQGC) measurement using the model independent way using the Effective Field Theory (EFT) for the dimension-eight operators with the data collected during 2016 (36 $fb^{-1}$) in the proton-proton collision at 13 TeV by the CMS detector. Among all the allowed processes, the process $pp \rightarrow WV jj$ and $pp \rightarrow ZV jj$ is used for the study. Here V denotes for W or Z boson and it always decay hadronically. The other vector boson in channel decays leptonically. The study starts with measuring the interference between the electroweak process $pp \rightarrow VV jj$ and the QCD initiated process. The study showed that we have less than 1\% interference between the two. The major background $W+jets$ was estimated in a data-driven way using the alpha-ratio method. The events are selected by requiring two jets with large rapidity separation having large di-jet invariant mass, one or two leptons (electrons or muons), and a boosted W or Z boson decaying hadronically. The hadronically decaying W/Z boson is reconstructed as one large radius jet having radius parameter 0.8. Finally, the limits on the dimension-eight operators are given using the frequentist approach in asymptotic approximation.


\textbf{Chapter 5} provides a summary of the work done during this PhD thesis for the physics analysis and the hardware work on the GE1/1 upgrade along with the lab development and the characterization of the GEM foil at the University of Delhi, India using the Indian made GEM foil. Also, this discuss the future prospects of the physics and hardware upgrade.
